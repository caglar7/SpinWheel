# SpinWheel  (Wheel of Fortune "Çarkıfelek" replica)


## **INTRODUCTION**
Spin Wheel is a Windows Forms Application puzzle game. In the game, I had to create solutions to make the items move, rotate or change their visibility depending on the user input. These items are PictureBoxes, Buttons, TextBoxes or Labels. To add functionality to these items, certain methods are used multiple times in Timers. There are Timers for each specific function of the game. These are the basic structures of this game project.

There are multiple forms in the game (3 in total) and these two above are created to make the game more user friendly. When “PLAY” button is clicked, it creates the second form object and hides the first one.

## **GAMEPLAY**
When the difficulty is selected on the second screen, the same process executed and another form object is created for game screen. When the game is started, there will be an animation at first then puzzles will be shown with their types. Throughout the game, we will be using “GUESS” and “SPIN”  to solve the puzzles.
